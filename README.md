We have investigated the efficacy of cascading adapters with transformer models to leverage high-resource language to improve the performance of low-resource languages on the question answering task. We trained four variants of adapter combinations for - Hindi, Arabic, German, Spanish, English, Vietnamese, and Simplified Chinese languages. We demonstrated that by using the transformer model with the multi-task adapters, the performance can be improved for the downstream task. Our results and analysis provide new insights into the generalization abilities of multilingual models for cross-lingual transfer on question answering tasks.
